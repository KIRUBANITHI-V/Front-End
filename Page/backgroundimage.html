        A rainbow is a multicolored arc made by light striking water droplets.

        The most familiar type rainbow is produced when sunlight strikes raindrops in front of a viewer at a precise angle (42 degrees). 
        Rainbows can also be viewed around fog, sea spray, or waterfalls.
        
        A rainbow is an optical illusionâ€”it does not actually exist in a specific spot in the sky. 
        The appearance of a rainbow depends on where you're standing and where the sun (or other source of light) is shining.
        
        The sun or other source of light is usually behind the person seeing the rainbow. 
        In fact, the center of a primary rainbow is the antisolar point, the imaginary point exactly opposite the sun.</p></pre>
