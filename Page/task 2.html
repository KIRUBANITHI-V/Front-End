        In my heart…
        I’ve tied you…
        I don’t know in which direction my day rose?
        You threw an innocent look at me!
        My mind, which couldn’t resist that, is like a wet mirror…
        A Colorful dollar chain, A watch on the right hand…
        And an authority that controls even Elephants and Tigers!
        
        Even after you had left
        Your shadow hasn’t gone
        It had fallen in my heart
        I rose up seeing this
        
        And after, I never went down
        My mind is straight like a metallic rib in an umbrella… <br>
        In my heart…

            I’ve tied you…
            I don’t know in which direction my day rose?
            
            Birds have slept already
            Milk has turned into curd
            Even the leaf in the tree has slept
            
            When people with Cancer could sleep
            I am infected with this desire and
            I Couldn’t sleep even for half-a-minute<br>

            In my heart…
            I’ve tied you…
            I don’t know in which direction my day rose?
                
            I couldn’t eat…
            My tongue is dry…
            It’s been 7 to 8 days and
            I haven’t even swallowed my saliva!
                
            I am a poor little girl
            who couldn’t express anything
            ike a rubber bangle
            Which couldn’t make any sound!
            I’ve tied you…
            I don’t know in which direction my day rose?
            You threw an innocent look at me!
            My mind, which couldn’t resist that, is like a wet mirror…
            A Colorful dollar chain, A watch on the right hand…
            And an authority that controls even Elephants and Tigers!
                
            Even after you had left
            Your shadow hasn’t gone
            It had fallen in my heart
            I rose up seeing this
                
            And after, I never went down
            My mind is straight like a metallic rib in an umbrella… <br>
