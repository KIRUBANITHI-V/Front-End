    <pre>
        Among the largest species of cats in the world, tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong 
        jaws and agile bodies. They range across Asia from Russia all the way to Sumatra and mainland 
        Southeast Asia. Researchers still have much to learn about these beautiful, endangered cats. 

        
        There is currently one recognized species of tiger, Panthera tigris. Scientists have further 
        classified the tiger into nine subspecies: the extinct Bali, Caspian and Javan subspecies, and the 
        living Malayan, Sumatran, South China, Indochinese, Bengal and Amur (or Siberian) subspecies. Of these 
        six subspecies, AZA-accredited zoos currently manage three: Amur, Malayan and Sumatran. The 
        Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute is home to Sumatran and Amur tigers; 
        Sumatran tigers are listed as Critically Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of 
        Nature's Red List, and Amur tigers have been classified as Endangered</pre>
