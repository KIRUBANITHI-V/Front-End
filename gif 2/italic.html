    <div><p>Generates italic text which you can copy and paste into facebook, twitter, instagram and other social media posts and statuses.
        Wondering wonder how how this works? It's pretty simple. There are a bunch of characters that exist, but are not included on your keyboard. In fact, there are over 100,000 of them! Emojis are examples of characters that aren't on a standard keyboard. So these italic characters are just characters in the Unicode standard that you don't see as common as the "normal" alphabetical characters (like the ones you're reading right now). That's why you're able to copy and paste this italic text into your instagram bio, Facebook posts, etc.</p>
